numbering-2-text-dissolve-paragraphs
====================================  

this is a ID CS6 script 4 SV.  

##prerequisites  
Create from your InDesign Footnotes Endnotes using [foot_to_endnote.jsx by Peter Kahrel.](http://www.kahrel.plus.com/indesign/foot_to_endnote.html)  

##What Happens  
1. It removes all [`paragraphDestinations`](http://jongware.mit.edu/idcs6js/pc_ParagraphDestinations.html) in the document  
2. It takes the selected story and converts all numbering to text via `convertBulletsAndNumberingToText()`.  
3. It converts TAB to WHITESPACE  
4. It converts LINEBREAK to WHITESPACE  
5. It converts CARRIDGE RETURN to DIGIT WHITESPACE  

##Usage  

1. Copy your pages with the endnote stories into a new document (drag & drop works fine)  
2. Select the first textframe of the story you want to dissolve.
3. Run the script
